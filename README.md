## User Story 

I updated the HTML so that the nav bar had working links that can locate you to its respective area on that web page

I added href attribute to <a> element to indicate link destination and this made the links live.

The <img> now has accessible alt attributes. The alt attributes contain alternative formatting describing the image to help accessibility. 


Source code now has semantic HTML elements, for example; changes include identifying div tags to the approprate section of the webpage like using <header> 

The HTML div tags have been changed according to changes in css stylesheet...
Grouped classes go under one class name e.g ".benefits , .section"
