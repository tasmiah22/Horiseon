# Horiseon

## Installation 

Navigate to <tasmiah22.github.io/Horiseon>
to locate the project


## User Story 

I updated the HTML so that the nav bar had working links that can locate you to its respective area on that web page
I added href attribute to <a> element to indicate link destination.
The <img> now has alt attributes.
css follows semantic structure.
css updated with comments to show what changed ie..
styles with the same code were grouped under one heading and this was also changed on the HTML.
