## User Story 

I updated the HTML so that the nav bar had working links that can locate you to its respective area on that web page
I added href to <a tag.
The <img> now has alt attributes.
css follows semantic structure.
css updated with comments. 
styles with the same code were grouped under one heading and this was also changed on the HTML.
